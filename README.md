SQL and NoSQL
I chose my domain as soccer. I scraped the dataset from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ankitasahni/exploring-soccer-analysis/data.
As it is known to us all, Soccer is a very popular sport in the world, great soccer clubs or players always have a huge quantity of fans, and a big event about soccer often aroused public attention and discussions on social media. So, it is a good domain to make analyses. In this project, I will model and gather data about my topic from Twitter.
There are three parts in the project: soccer data, social media data and 3 tables including misspelled, synonyms and semantic.
Soccer data has 4 tables: soccer full data, nationality, club, player.
Social media data include 3 table: tweet full data, tweets and hashtags.
 
There are 5 entities in my project: Nationality, Club, Player, Soccer hashtags , Soccer tweets .
